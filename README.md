# Deep-Learnning-Semantic-sementation

The aim of this study is

I. To carry out a semantic image segmentation on 16 different band combinations using
RGB, Near-Infrared (I) and canopy height model (H) with the channels and
combinations below;
a) RGBIH (one combination, with 5 bands).
b) RGBI, RGBH, RGIH, RBIH, GBIH (five combinations with 4 bands)
c) RGB, RGI, RGH, RBI, RBH, RIH, GBI, GBH, GIH, BIH (ten combinations with 3
bands)
II. Evaluate the performance of semantic segmentation with the mean intersection over
Union on each of the 16 different band combinations
